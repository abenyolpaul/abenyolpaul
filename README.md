# Kataboi Girls Secondary School: Student Performance Tracker

This project aims to analyze and track the academic performance of students in Mathematics and Geography from Form 2 to Form 4 at Kataboi Girls Secondary School. With an estimated 1,230 students, the goal is to provide insights into trends, strengths, and areas needing improvement.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track student performance across three academic years (Form 2 to Form 4)
- Visualize performance trends in Mathematics and Geography
- Identify top-performing students and those needing academic support
- Provide actionable insights for teachers and administrators

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- GitHub for version control and sharing

## 🚀 How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kataboi-student-performance-tracker.git
Open student_performance_tracker.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Run all cells from top to bottom. Ensure performance_data.csv is in the data/ folder.

📊 Sample Insights
Average performance in Geography improved by 12% from Form 2 to Form 4.

Mathematics scores showed a dip in Form 3, suggesting curriculum or teaching challenges.

15% of students consistently scored above 80% in both subjects.

💡 Reflections
This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in education. By tracking performance longitudinally, educators can better tailor interventions and celebrate academic growth.

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.boxplot(data=df, x='Form', y='Maths_Score')
plt.title('Maths Score Distribution by Form')
plt.show()
5. Performance Trends
Line charts showing average scores per form

Identify students with consistent performance

6. Top Performers & At-Risk Students
python
top_students = df[(df['Maths_Score'] > 80) & (df['Geography_Score'] > 80)]
at_risk = df[(df['Maths_Score'] < 40) | (df['Geography_Score'] < 40)]
7. Recommendations
Suggested interventions

Recognition programs for top performers

8. Conclusion
Summary of findings

Next steps (e.g., expanding to other subjects)

✅ Final Steps
Once your notebook runs smoothly:

Upload everything to GitHub.

Double-check that your README.md is clear and professional.

Would you like me to generate the sample CSV file (`performance_data.csv`) with mock student data so you can upload it directly to your repo? I can also help you polish the notebook for presentation.
yes generate
See my thinking
Looks like there was a hiccup generating the CSV file just now. No worries—I can still create a realistic sample right here that you can copy and save manually.

📄 Sample: performance_data.csv
Here’s a preview of the first few rows:

csv
Student_ID,Name,Form,Maths_Score,Geography_Score
1001,Amina Kiptoo,2,65,72
1002,Faith Cheruiyot,3,58,80
1003,Beatrice Njeri,4,82,77
1004,Joyce Atieno,2,45,60
1005,Mercy Wanjiku,3,39,48
1006,Stacy Chebet,4,91,85
1007,Naomi Mwikali,2,70,68
1008,Gloria Nekesa,3,55,73
1009,Janet Wambui,4,62,59
1010,Lucy Achieng,2,88,90
📝 How to Use It
Open any text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).

Paste the data above.

Save the file as performance_data.csv.

Place it inside a folder named data in your GitHub repo.

Would you like me to generate a larger dataset (e.g., 1,230 rows) and help you upload it to GitHub using Python or Excel? I can also help you create charts and summaries based on this data.

What types of charts can I create from this data?
Great question, Paul! With your student performance data, you can create a variety of charts to uncover trends, compare scores, and highlight insights. Here’s a breakdown of the most useful chart types for your project:

📊 Recommended Chart Types
1. Line Chart
Purpose: Show score trends across Forms (Form 2 to Form 4)

📈 Average Maths and Geography scores per Form

📈 Performance progression for individual students

python
sns.lineplot(data=df, x='Form', y='Maths_Score', label='Maths')
sns.lineplot(data=df, x='Form', y='Geography_Score', label='Geography')
2. Bar Chart
Purpose: Compare average scores or student counts

📊 Average score per subject by Form

📊 Number of top performers per Form

python
df.groupby('Form')[['Maths_Score', 'Geography_Score']].mean().plot(kind='bar')
3. Box Plot
Purpose: Show score distribution and detect outliers

📦 Distribution of scores in Maths and Geography

📦 Compare spread across Forms

python
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='Form', y='Maths_Score')

4. Histogram
Purpose: Show frequency of scores

📊 How many students scored within certain ranges (e.g., 40–60, 60–80)

df['Maths_Score'].hist(bins=10)

5. Scatter Plot
Purpose: Show correlation between Maths and Geography scores

🔍 Are students who perform well in Maths also strong in Geography?

python
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='Maths_Score', y='Geography_Score')
6. Pie Chart (Use sparingly)
Purpose: Show proportions

🥧 Percentage of students in performance categories (e.g., top, average, at-risk)

python
labels = ['Top', 'Average', 'At-Risk']
sizes = [180, 800, 250]
plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
